\title{Calculate a Diffusion Index}
\usage{
create_diffusion_index(
  pct_increased = NULL,
  pct_decreased = NULL,
  pct_unchanged = NULL,
  pct_change = NULL,
  idx_type = c("Federal Reserve", "IHS-PMI", "Conference Board")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pct_increased}{Numeric scalar or vector: percent of items that increased.}

\item{pct_decreased}{Numeric scalar or vector: percent of items that decreased.}

\item{pct_unchanged}{Numeric scalar or vector: percent of items unchanged.}

\item{pct_change}{Numeric scalar or vector: percent change for Conference Board method.}

\item{idx_type}{Character string: one of "Federal Reserve" (default), "IHS-PMI", or "Conference Board".}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the diffusion index.
}
\description{
Computes a diffusion index using one of several popular methodologies.
}
\details{
Supported index types include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"Federal Reserve"}: Difference between percent increased and decreased, multiplied by 100.
\item \code{"IHS-PMI"}: Sum of percent increased and half the percent unchanged.
\item \code{"Conference Board"}: Encodes percent change into categorical scores (1, 0.5, 0) and returns the mean.
}
}
\examples{
create_diffusion_index(pct_increased = c(0.6, 0.5), pct_decreased = c(0.2, 0.3))
create_diffusion_index(pct_increased = 0.55, pct_unchanged = 0.30, idx_type = "IHS-PMI")
create_diffusion_index(pct_change = c(0.001, -0.001, 0.0001), idx_type = "Conference Board")

}
